# Workflow Automation Architecture

This document defines the architecture, responsibilities, and design principles of the workflow automation layer in Project NOAH.

---

## Purpose

The workflow automation layer is responsible for orchestrating services, automating repetitive tasks, and enabling communication between AI components and external systems.

Project NOAH uses n8n as its primary workflow automation platform.

---

## Why n8n

Project NOAH uses n8n because it provides:

- Visual workflow automation
- Docker-friendly deployment
- API-first architecture
- Extensive integration ecosystem
- Low-code development
- High extensibility through custom nodes

n8n enables Project NOAH to automate complex processes without unnecessary application code.

---

## Core Responsibilities

The workflow automation layer is responsible for:

- Workflow orchestration
- AI pipeline automation
- Scheduled tasks
- API integration
- Database interaction
- File processing
- Notification delivery
- Agent communication

---

## Integration with PostgreSQL

Workflow metadata and configuration are stored in PostgreSQL.

Current database:

```text
noah
```

Database container:

```text
noah-postgres
```

Communication occurs through the Docker network.

---

## AI Integration

Future workflows will communicate with AI services such as:

- Ollama
- OpenAI
- Anthropic Claude

Typical responsibilities include:

- Local LLM inference
- AI agent execution
- Text generation
- Classification
- Summarization
- Decision support

---

## User Interface Integration

Workflow automation may communicate with user-facing services, including:

- Open WebUI
- Future web dashboards
- API endpoints

These integrations provide users with access to Project NOAH's automated workflows.

---

## Workflow Design Principles

Every workflow should follow these principles:

- Single responsibility
- Reusable components
- Modular design
- Easy debugging
- Clear documentation
- Version control whenever possible

Large workflows should be divided into smaller reusable workflows.

---

## Folder Structure

Workflow-related resources will be organized as follows:

```text
project-noah/

n8n/
├── README.md
├── workflows/
├── templates/
├── credentials/
└── backups/
```

This structure may evolve as Project NOAH grows.

---

## Security Policy

Sensitive information must never be hardcoded.

Credentials should be managed using:

- Docker environment variables
- n8n Credentials
- Secret management (future)

Sensitive information includes:

- Database passwords
- API keys
- Access tokens
- Secrets

These values must never be committed to Git.

---

## Backup Strategy

Future backup strategy includes:

- Workflow exports
- Credential backups
- PostgreSQL backups
- Docker Volume backups
- Restore validation

---

## Future Expansion

The workflow automation layer may integrate with:

- GitHub
- Notion
- Discord
- Slack
- Gmail
- Google Calendar
- Telegram
- Synology NAS
- Ollama
- OpenAI
- Anthropic Claude

Additional services may be added as Project NOAH evolves.

---

## Design Principles

Project NOAH follows these workflow automation principles:

- Automation first
- Documentation before implementation
- Docker-first deployment
- Secure integration
- Reusable workflows
- Long-term maintainability
- Scalability
- Reproducible infrastructure
